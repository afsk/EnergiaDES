EnergiaDES
==========

DES and Triples DES encryption and decryption for the Energia platform.

This code was ported from the ArduinoDES
(<https://github.com/Octoate/ArduinoDES>).

To install the library, download and copy the files into a subfolder (e.g. 
"DES") in the "libraries" folder of your Energia development environment.

The library was tested on a Stellaris Launchpad.


Usage
=====

It is possible to encrypt and decrypt messages with the DES or Triples DES
crypto algorithms. Have a look at the example code for more information.
